# GIJamFall2018
A game made for the GI Game Jam, Fall 2018.

Control a snake! Complete obstacle courses! No sounds or pretty pictures to distract you. This is serious business. Youâ€™ll need to balance slithering and swinging to achieve true snake nirvana. Play it in your browser here: https://asemahle.github.io/GIJamFall2018/.

Coded on a chromebook. Uses Matterjs for physics, and levels were created using the Tiled editor.
